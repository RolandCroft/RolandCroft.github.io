# About Me
My name is Roland Croft and I am a PhD candidate at CREST research group in the University of Adelaide, Australia.  

My research focuses on the use of AI and data driven techniques to achieve software security. I collect and analyze open source security intelligence to power machine learning techniques for software security analytics.  

My research interests particularly lie in data quality and security intelligence. In addition to my primary line of research, I am also interested in various other empirical software engineering topics.
